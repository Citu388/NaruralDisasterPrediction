# NaruralDisasterPrediction
Natural disaster prediction system that utilize environmental data to predict and identify potential natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and earthquakes. A natural disaster prediction model is like a smart AI tool that helps us know when and where a disaster like a hurricane, flood, or earthquake might happen. The system collects data from various sources, such as weather stations, satellites, and historical records. This data includes information about weather patterns, seismic activities, and other relevant environmental factors. The collected data is processed and analyzed using AI algorithms and machine learning techniques. Based on the analysis, the system develops prediction models specific to different types of natural disasters, such as floods, earthquakes, wildfires and hurricanes. The system continuously monitors the real-time data to detect any changes or unusual patterns that could signify an impending natural disaster. It compares the current environmental conditions with the patterns observed in historical data to make predictions. When system identifies natural disaster, it generates early warnings and alerts. The prediction system helps emergency management agencies, government, and others incharge of responding to disasters. It gives them important information to make smart decisions about things like when to evacuate people, where to send resources, and how to respond to the disaster. It also gives them advice on how to get ready before the disaster happens, so they can reduce its impact as much as possible.


Algorithms Used: 
1) Convolution neural Network(CNN) : It is a deep learning technique primarily used for image recognition and analysis tasks. It is particularly effective in detecting patterns and features within images.
2) Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) : This algorithm can be applied to natural disaster prediction, especially when dealing with time-series data.
